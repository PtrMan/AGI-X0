JVersionSpaces Installation instructions

Author: Rogan Creswick <creswick_at_gmail_dot_com>

We use maven for the build infrastructure, so "installation" is
simple:

To generate a jar (in target/versionspaces-[release version].jar):

    $ mvn package


To generate the javadocs, test coverage, etc.. the easiest thing is to
just generate the full maven site:

    $ mvn site

Once you have the package, just treat it as you would any java jar.
