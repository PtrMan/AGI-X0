* microstep physics simulation
	* correct fracture position calculation
	* accelerate fractures with (speed of physics object)

seralization
============

implement creation and wiring of components of objects, such as timer, proximity detector, event remapper, etc.

graphics
========

implement rotation of frustum mesh

AI
==

usage of VehicleAlignToCommand  with an AI controlled ship

TODO< build AI controlled ship and give it an test direction >

interaction
===========




* missile ignition for testmissile

* timer component to delay after activation events
     * also with reset functionality


* explosion effect
    - fragemnt solids bould to physics object
	- accelerate fragments

	- destroy solids from solidresponsibility

	- destroy object
		- reomve all bound objects from lookuptables
		- remove all bound proximity detectors from lookup tables and physics engine
		- destroy physics object




THINK SOLVED
*** how do we inform the entity about changes of it's proximity detector

THINK SOLVED
*** how do we bind the user input to the spawned "ship"
   * we need to give an hinto to the factory that it has to be spawned with an controller
   * controller has to somehow transfer the strenth to the thursters


physics engine

* with blacklist of PhysicsComponent for explosivePayloadIgnitionProximityDetector
   (partially solved)

* [low priority] solar systems

* [low priority] acceleration for particles

* [low priority] planets and gravity

* [low priority] sweep for proximity detector so it detects fast objects

* [low priority] optimize kdop test
    * use abs(a.center - b.center) < a.width + b.width  faster test for overlap test
	* usage of SIMD

renderer
* abstract renderer into interface
