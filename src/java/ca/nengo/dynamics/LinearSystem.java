 * <p>A linear dynamical system, which may or may not be time-varying. We use 
 * the state-space model of linear systems, which consist of four (possibly 
 * time-varying) matrices.</p>
 * 
 * TODO: ref chen
 * 
 * <p>The distinction between linear and non-linear dynamical systems is 
 * important, because many assumptions that hold for linear systems do not hold 
 * in general. For this rule, only linear systems can be used in some situations,
 * and we need this interface to enforce their use.</p>
