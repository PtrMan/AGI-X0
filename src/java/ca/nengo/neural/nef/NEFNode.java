 * <p>A Node with a distinguished Termination that corresponds to a net  
 * effect of input. This direct channel is used by NEFEnsembles. NEFEnsembles  
 * run more efficiently by combining and filtering inputs at the Ensemble  
 * level, so that these same combinations and filterings need not be performed  
 * multiple times, for each Node in the Ensemble. Differences in net input to 
 * the different Nodes in an NEFEnsemble are accounted for by encoding vectors
 * (see Eliasmith & Anderson, 2003).</p> 
 * 
 * <p>There can also be additional inputs to an NEFNode, beyond the distinguished  
 * input. The manner in which such inputs are combined with each other 
 * and with the distinguished input is determined by the NEFNode. </p>
