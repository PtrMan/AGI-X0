   WARNING - SEEMS UNSTABLE

 * File: CuckooMap2.java
 * Author: Keith Schwarz (htiek@cs.stanford.edu)
 * http://www.keithschwarz.com/interesting/code/cuckoo-hashmap/
 * An implementation of a hash map backed by a cuckoo hash table.  Cuckoo hash
 * tables, first described in "Cuckoo Hashing" by Pugh and Rodler, is a hash
 * system with worst-case constant-time lookup and deletion, and amortized
 * expected O(1) insertion.
 *
 * Internally, cuckoo hashing works by maintaining two arrays of some size,
 * along with two universal hash functions f and g.  When an element x is
 * inserted, the value f(x) is computed and the entry is stored in that spot
 * in the first array.  If that spot was initially empty, we are done.
 * Otherwise, the element that was already there (call it y) is "kicked out."
 * We then compute g(y) and store element y at position g(y) in the second
 * array, which may in turn kick out another element, which will be stored in
 * the first array.  This process repeats until either a loop is detected (in
 * which case we pick a new hash function and rehash), or all elements finally
 * come to rest.
 *
 * The original paper by Pugh and Rodler proves a strong bound - for any
 * epsilon greater than zero, if the load factor of a Cuckoo hash table is at
 * most (1/2 - epsilon)n, then both the expected runtime and variance of
 * the expected runtime for an insertion is amortized O(1).  This means that
 * we will always want to keep the load factor at just below 50%, say, at 40%.
 *
 * The main challenge of implementing a cuckoo hash table in Java is that the
 * hash code provided for each object is not drawn from a universal hash
 * function.  To ameliorate this, internally we will choose a universal hash
 * function to apply to the hash code of each element.  This is only a good
 * hash if the hash codes for objects are distributed somewhat uniformly, but
 * we assume that this is the case.  If it isn't true - and in particular, if
 * more than two objects of the type hash to the same value - then all bets
 * are off and the cuckoo hash table will entirely fail.  Internally, the
 * class provides a default hash function (described below), but complex class
 * implementations should provide their own implementation.
 *
 * Our family of universal hash functions is based on the universal hash
 * functions described by Mikkel Thorup in "String Hashing for Linear Probing."
 * We begin by breaking the input number into two values, a lower 16-bit value
 * and an upper 16-bit value (denoted HIGH and LOW), then picking two random
 * 32-bit values A and B (which will remain constant across any one hash
 * function from this family).  We then compute
 *
 *           HashCode = ((HIGH + A) * (LOW * B)) / (2^(32 - k))
 *
 * Where 2^k is the number of buckets we're hashing into.
