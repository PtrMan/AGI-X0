/** A vector of bits, a&#46;k&#46;a&#46; bit sequence, bit string, binary word, etc.
 * 
 * <P>This interface define several operations on finite sequences of bits.
 * Efficient implementations, such as {@link LongArrayBitVector},
 * use approximately one bit of memory for each bit in the vector, but this is not enforced.
 * 
 * <P>Operation of a bit vector are partially of boolean nature 
 * (e.g., logical operations between vectors),
 * partially of language-theoretical nature (e.g., concatenation), and 
 * partially of set-theoretical nature (e.g., asking which bits are set to one). 
 * To accomodate all these points of view, this interface extends  
 * {@link it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.booleans.BooleanList}, but also provides an
 * {@link #asLongSet()} method that exposes a {@link java.util.BitSet}-like view
 * and a {@link #asLongBigList(int)} method that provides integer-like access to
 * blocks of bits of given width.
 * 
 * <P>Most, if not all, classical operations on bit vectors can be seen as standard
 * operations on these two views: for instance, the number of bits set to one is just
 * the number of elements of the set returned by {@link #asLongSet()} (albeit a direct {@link #count()} method
 * is provided, too). The standard {@link java.util.Collection#addAll(java.util.Collection)} method
 * can be used to concatenate bit vectors, and {@linkplain List#subList(int, int) sublist views}
 * make it easy performing any kind of logical operation on subvectors.
 * 
 * <P>The only <i>caveat</i> is that sometimes the standard interface naming clashes slightly
 * with standard usage: for instance, {@link #clear(long)} will <em>not</em> set to zero
 * all bits (use {@link #fill(int) fill(0)} for that purpose), but rather will set the
 * vector length to zero. Also, {@link #add(long, int)} will not add logically a value at
 * the specified index, but rather will insert a new bit with the specified value at the specified
 * position.
 * 
 * <P>The {@link AbstractBitVector} class provides a fairly complete
 * abstract implementation that provides all methods except for the most
 * basic operations. Of course, the methods of {@link AbstractBitVector} are
 * very inefficient, but implementations such as {@link LongArrayBitVector}
 * have their own optimised implementations.
